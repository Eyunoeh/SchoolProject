ATM Case Study
The ATM Case Study project is a simulation of an automated teller machine (ATM) that allows users to perform various banking operations,
such as viewing their balance, withdrawing cash, and depositing funds.

Classes
BankDatabase
The BankDatabase class stores information about all accounts in the bank, including the account number, PIN, and balance. This information
is stored in a HashMap where the account number is the key and the Account object is the value.

Account
The Account class stores information about a single bank account, including the account number, PIN, and balance. It has getter and setter
methods for accessing and updating this information.

Keypad
The Keypad class is an abstract class that provides a template for a keypad with abstract methods for displaying the welcome message and main menu.

Screen
The Screen class extends the Keypad class and implements the abstract methods for displaying the welcome message and main menu. It also has
a method for prompting the user to enter their account number and PIN.

Atm
The Atm class handles security and transactions for the ATM. It has a method for checking if the account number and PIN entered by the
user are valid, and a method for performing transactions based on the user's selection from the main menu.

Transaction
The Transaction class has a method for performing a transaction based on the user's selection from the main menu. It simulates processing 
time by sleeping the thread for 5 seconds.

CashDispenser
The CashDispenser class has a method for simulating the withdrawal of cash from the ATM.

Running the Program
To run the program, simply run the AtmCaseStudy class. The program will continuously prompt the user to enter their account number and
PIN, and perform the selected transaction if the account number and PIN are valid. The program will exit if the user selects the "Exit"
option from the main menu.
